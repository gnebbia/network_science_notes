# Introduction to Networks

This section introduces the basic network science definitions.  Then,
different types of networks are exposed and motivations of why we study
them in the real world are explained. We learn about the basic elements
of networks, as well as different types of networks. You'll also learn
how to represent and manipulate networked data using the NetworkX library.
