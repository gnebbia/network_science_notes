# Network Evolution

In this section we explore the evolution of networks over time, including
the different models that generate networks with realistic features, such
as the Preferential Attachment Model and Small World Networks. We 
also explore the link prediction problem, where we will learn useful
features that can predict whether a pair of disconnected nodes will be
connected in the future.
