# Network Influence Measures and Centralization

In this section we analyze ways of measuring the importance or centrality
of a node in a network, using measures such as Degree, Closeness, and
Betweenness centrality, Page Rank, and Hubs and Authorities. Additionally
we learn about the assumptions each measure makes, the algorithms we can
use to compute them, and the different functions available on NetworkX
to measure centrality.
